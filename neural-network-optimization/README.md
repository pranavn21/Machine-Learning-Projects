# Neural Network Optimization
This code optimizes the performance of a neural net by trying various combinations of hyper-parameters and evaluating their results. I did by pre-processing the data (handling null values, ensuring data integrity, and standardization of attributes) and then I developed the train_evaluate method which did the following:

– Created different neural networks with all possible combinations of hyperparameters specified.

– Kept track of model history i.e. model performance (accuracy) vs
number of epochs in every case. Plot the model history for all the
cases on a single plot.

– Displayed a table of results containing following columns: model hyperparameters, training and test accuracies, and training and test errors (e.g. mean squared error)

How to run: This is a python code genertated with Google Colab Python notebooks. Ensure you are in the proper directory if using a terminal and run the following command: python <path_to_file>.py

If you are running via an IDE, then make sure that Python is installed and simply press Run.
